Design Patterns PHP

Design Patterns can be categorized into three main categories:

1. Creational
1. Structural
1. Behavioral
1. Creational Patterns:

These patterns deal with object-creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a way that is more flexible, efficient, and easy to understand.

1. Abstract Factory
1. Builder
1. Factory Method
1. Pool
1. Prototype
1. Simple Factory
1. Singleton
1. Static Factory
2. Structural Patterns:

Structural design patterns are a set of design patterns that focus on how objects and classes are organized and structured to form larger components or systems. These patterns are concerned with the relationships between objects and classes, and how they work together to achieve a particular behavior or functionality.

Structural design patterns can be used to solve common design problems related to object composition, interface compatibility, and component communication.

1. Adaptar / Wrapper
1. Bridge
1. Composite
1. Data Mapper
1. Decorator
1. Dependency Injection
1. Facade
1. Fluent interface
1. Flyweight
1. Proxy
1. Registry
3. Behavioral

These design patterns focus on how objects and classes interact with each other to achieve a particular behavior or functionality. These patterns define the interaction patterns and communication between objects, classes, and their relationships.

1. Chain Of Resposibilites
1. Command
1. Interpreter
1. Iterator
1. Mediator
1. Memento
1. Null Object
1. Observer
1. Specification
10. State
10. Strategy
10. Template Method
10. Visitor
1. Creational:
1. Abstract Factory: It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to create objects that belong to a common family or group, but have different implementations based on the specific factory used.
